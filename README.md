## Notes
- Ensure that these image paths are correct relative to the `README.md` file's location in the project.
- If you're using Next.js, you might want to move these images to the `public` directory and reference them like so:
  ```markdown
  ![Image 1](/output/image1.png)
  ![Image 2](/output/image2.png)
  ![Image 3](/output/image3.png)
